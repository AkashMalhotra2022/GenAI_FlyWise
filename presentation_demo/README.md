## Overview

FlyWise is a multi-agent AI system where specialized agents work together to create comprehensive, personalized travel plans. The system considers your unique travel persona—including your interests, personality type, and spending power—to recommend the perfect flights, hotels, and activities.

Instead of generic recommendations, FlyWise provides:
- **Budget-conscious recommendations** tailored to your spending power (Low/Medium/High)
- **Persona-based customization** matching your travel experience preferences (Adventure, Art History, Food & Culture, etc.)
- **Character-aligned suggestions** suited to your personality (Extrovert, Explorer, Introvert, etc.)
- **Complete trip budget breakdown** with detailed cost estimates

The system leverages:
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM**: Powers intelligent, personalized recommendations
- **CrewAI**: Coordinates multi-agent workflow for comprehensive planning
- **SerpAPI**: Retrieves real-time flight and hotel data
- **FastAPI**: Handles backend API endpoints efficiently
- **Streamlit**: Provides intuitive, user-friendly interface

## Architecture

### Persona-Driven Multi-Agent System

The application uses a sophisticated AI system with specialized agents that consider your unique travel profile:

1. **Flight Analyst Agent**:
   - Analyzes options based on your spending power tier
   - Recommends cheapest, best value, or premium flights accordingly
   - Considers personality type for duration and convenience preferences
   - Provides detailed reasoning for recommendations

2. **Hotel Analyst Agent**:
   - Evaluates hotels matching your budget tier
   - Highlights locations near attractions relevant to your travel experience
   - Considers character type for social atmosphere and amenities
   - Offers personalized pros and cons analysis

3. **Travel Planner Agent**:
   - Creates itineraries tailored to your interests (adventure, art, food)
   - Suggests activities matching your character type (social vs. quiet)
   - Plans dining and transportation within your spending power
   - Includes budget breakdown with realistic cost estimates

### Project Structure

- `gemini2_travel_v2.py`: FastAPI backend with persona-aware AI agents and API endpoints
- `gemini2_travel_v2_frontend.py`: Streamlit frontend with persona configuration interface
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
- `images/`: Demonstration images and GIFs

## Implementation Highlights

### Persona System
```python
class UserPersona(BaseModel):
    travel_experience: str = "Adventure"  # Adventure, Art History, Food & Culture
    character_interests: str = "Extrovert"  # Extrovert, Introvert, Explorer, Relaxation Seeker
    spending_power: str = "Medium"  # Low, Medium, High
```

### Spending Power Logic
- **Low**: Prioritizes cheapest options, accepts trade-offs
- **Medium**: Seeks best value, balances price with quality
- **High**: Focuses on premium experiences regardless of price

### Budget Calculation
Automatically calculates:
- Fixed costs (flights, hotels)
- Variable costs (food, activities, transportation)
- Daily estimates based on spending power
- Total trip budget range
